# Disable Automatic Update Plugin Success Emails

A lightweight plugin that disables email notifications for successful plugin updates while ensuring notifications for failed and critical updates are still sent.

## Description

**Disable Automatic Update Plugin Success Emails** is a simple and efficient plugin designed to give you better control over WordPress automatic update email notifications for plugins. By default, WordPress sends email notifications for every update. This plugin suppresses those emails for successful plugin updates but continues to send notifications for:

- Failed plugin updates.
- Critical plugin updates.

### Key Features:
- Suppresses email notifications for successful plugin updates.
- Allows email notifications for failed and critical updates.
- No settings pageâ€”just activate and enjoy a cleaner inbox!

### Why?
Sending an email on success serves no real purpose, we only really want to know when something needs our attention. That said it works best combined with some sort of activity log.
